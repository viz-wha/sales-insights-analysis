This repository contains the code, documentation, and assets for the Real-time Sales Dashboard project. Developed as part of a data analysis initiative, this project provides actionable sales insights for Atliq Hardwaresâ€”a computer hardware business facing revenue challenges in a dynamic market environment.

## Overview

Atliq Hardwares was struggling to increase revenue due to data silos and a lack of real-time insights. The sales director needed an interactive, data-driven tool to monitor sales trends and identify opportunities for revenue growth. This project addresses that need by consolidating data from multiple sources using SQL and visualizing it with Tableau.

## Project Context

**Situation:**  
Atliq Hardwares was experiencing stagnant revenue in a competitive market. The existing reporting systems did not provide timely, actionable insights, making it difficult for decision-makers to react to emerging trends.

**Task:**  
As a Data Analyst, the goal was to create a unified, real-time dashboard that tracks key performance indicators such as year-over-year (YOY) trends and regional sales performance, providing the sales director with the insights needed for data-driven decisions.

**Action:**  
- **Data Extraction & Integration:**  
  - Utilized SQL to extract and preprocess data from multiple internal sources, ensuring a single reliable dataset.
- **Dashboard Development:**  
  - Designed and implemented an interactive dashboard in Tableau that visually represents YOY trends and regional performance.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:**  
  - Worked closely with the sales team to define essential metrics and iteratively refine the dashboard based on feedback.
- **Real-time Capability:**  
  - Set up processes to support real-time data updates, ensuring that the dashboard reflects the most current data.

**Result:**  
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:**  
  - Empowered the sales director to make quick, informed decisions based on live data.
- **Revenue Impact:**  
  - The dashboard contributed to an estimated 7% revenue increase in the following quarter.
- **Improved Data Reporting:**  
  - Established a reliable, real-time reporting system that can be scaled for future projects.
